    "* transforming the values at our disposal into a representation that a given machine learning algorithm can use and understand\n",
    "* creating new, derived features from the available features (using domain expertise) and use them when training a model\n",
    "* dealing with missing values, as most ML algorithms can't handle unknown values. They must be filled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with the first case, transformation, and talk about the three most common transformations necessary to get data into a state where it can be used to train most ML models:\n",
    "* **feature scaling**: making it so that all columns (features) range over the same values is very helpful for many (but not all) machine learning models. In some cases, scaling along samples is useful, as well.\n",
    "* **turning categorical values into numerical values**: machine learning algorithms only understand numbers, not categories.\n",
    "* **handling missing values**: Models break when you give them `NaN`s, what are some strategies to replace `NaN`s with \"good\" (i.e. useful) numbers?"
